We’ll start with the standard Svelte template, installed with degit:

    $ npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-with-sass

Then cd into the new project, install everything, and also install the
svelte-preprocess package, along with node-sass.

    $ cd svelte-with-sass
    $ npm install
    $ npm install svelte-preprocess node-sass

Open up the rollup.config.js file that came with the project. There are just a
couple changes to make:

    // add this import at the top:
    import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess';

    /* ... */

    // and add preprocess as a plugin:
    export default {
        /* ... */
        plugins: [
            svelte({
            /* ... */
            preprocess: preprocess()
            })
        }),
        /* ... */
    }

After that, try npm run dev again, open up the page.

    $ npm run dev

First, make sure you have the Svelte for VSCode extension installed:

    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode

Then, open up your VSCode settings, type “svelte” in the search box, and look
for this option called “Svelte > Language-server: Runtime”:

    In the box, enter the location of your Node.js binary.

The location can be found with the Windows command:

    $ where node

Make sure you already installed the svelte-preprocess module and node-sass
from earlier, and then create a file in the root of your project called
svelte.config.js:

    // svelte.config.js
    const preprocess = require('svelte-preprocess');

    module.exports = {
        preprocess: preprocess(),
        // ...other svelte options could go here
    };

Restart VSCode
